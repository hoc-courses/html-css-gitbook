# Forking a GitHub Repository

You fork a repository when you want to create a copy of someone else's repository in your own GitHub account. There are two use-cases for forking a GitHub repository.

* want to have a private copy of a repository from someone else's account.
* want to contribute to an open-source project.

Once you have forked the repository, it exists in your GitHub account, but does not yet exist on your local computer as a local repository. To do that you would just clone the repository.

We'll defer the process of contributing to an open source project for now and just use fork as a way to copy a repository from my GitHub account to start a private copy in your own GitHub account.
