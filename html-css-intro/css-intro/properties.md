### What aspects of an HTML element can be styled?

The list is quite long. They can be loosely categorized into styles that deal with text and font, colors and backgrounds, margins, padding, and borders, and dimensions, display and positioning.

Some of the styles, such as those for setting basic text and color properties, are very easy to learn. Some of the others require a deeper understanding of how elements are rendered on the screen.
