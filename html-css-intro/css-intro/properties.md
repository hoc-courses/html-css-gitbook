# Properties

## What aspects of an HTML element can be styled?

The list is quite long. They can be loosely categorized into styles that deal with:

* text and font
* colors and backgrounds 
* margins, padding, and borders, and dimensions \(see [box-model properties](box-model-box-sizing.md) topic\)
* display and positioning.

Some of the styles, such as those for setting basic text and color properties, are very easy to learn. Some of the others require a deeper understanding of how elements are rendered on the screen.

This [reference ](https://cssreference.io/)is a very good guide. It provides a nice explanation, and visual example, for each property. There are a few more CSS cheat sheets in the Appendix section.

These topics go into more detail on some of the bigger styling concepts.
