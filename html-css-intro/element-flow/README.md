# Element Flow

Here are some very important characteristics of how elements are rendered on a page:

### [Box Model](box-model-box-sizing.md)

* Every element on a page is displayed as a rectangular box
* Box margin is the space between boxes, outside of the box's border.
* Box padding is the space within the box between the border and the content.

### Element Flow

* Without added positioning styles, the boxes flow from top to bottom

### [Block Elements](element-flow-part-2.md) \(display:block\)

* The box will break onto a new line .
* The box will extend horizontally to fill the space available in its container.

### [Inline Elements](element-flow-part-2.md) \(display:inline\)

* The box will not break onto a new line.
* The box will only take up as much horizontal space as is necessary.
