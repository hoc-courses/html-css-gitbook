# Course Folder

### Creating A Course Projects Folder

Create a folder named **web-dev-fall-2021**, where will you will put the project files for the course. Do not create the folder through the Desktop.  Use the Git Bask shell to execute these commands.

From the Windows Start menu, type in **Git Bash** to bring up a Git Bash shell. 

To create a new directory you use the **mkdir** command.  You can decide for yourself where you want this course folder to reside. For this tutorial, I am going to create it on my D drive at the top level.

First, use the **cd** command to change to the root of the drive \(I am using my D drive\). Then create the new directory using the **mkdir** command. Finally, use the **cd** command to navigate into the new folder.
