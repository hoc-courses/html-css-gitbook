# Slack Intro

You should have received an email invitation to join a slack workspace for our class. Accept the invitation and say hi in the discussion channel.

Slack is very easy and intuitive, so we don't need to spend a lot of time going over it. They only specifics for our course is that we're going to just have a single channel for class discussion, named general. That's where you can post questions to the group and I will also listen there. 

If you want to communicate privately with me or another person, you just select their name in the Direct messages section, and post the message there.
