# Week 2: Saturday 10/9

### CSS Grid 

There are a lot of features of CSS grid. Too many to master now. But we want to get a good understanding of the fundamentals for how grids are laid out, how to place items, and how to use grid template areas.

### CSS Grid - Wes Bos

The following video is a very detailed review of the grid feature by Wes Bos. Firefox paid for the video, so he is using the Firefox browser, which does have the best support for grid in the inspector. At the time of the video, the Chrome Dev Tools didn't have very good support for inspecting grids, but it has since almost caught up. You can look in both browsers and compare to see which one you find more useful.

You should focus on sections 1-11, and Grid Template Areas and the Grid Practice - Spanning and Placing Cardio.
