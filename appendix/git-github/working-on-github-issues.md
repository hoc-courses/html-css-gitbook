# Working on GitHub Issues

### Check for New Issues

To see if you have any new issues, switch to the GitHub Issues Extension on the Activities bar on the left \(has the GitHub cat icon\) and click the refresh icon in the area outlined with "Controls appear here...". The controls only appear when you hover, so they don't appear in the screen capture.
